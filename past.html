    IT past
  </h2>
<p class = "IT-past">
  I began getting into IT when I was in year 6, studying in Dubai. IT begain with
  programming a very simple game. I then decided to put more effort into studying
  IT. This led to me studying both IPT and SDD in Year 11 and 12, achiving a band 5
  in both subjects.

<p class = "IT-past">
  This also led to me studying information Systems at UTS, which I am currently
  in my first semester. IT has always been one of my favourite subjects, and being
  able to move into a career is a real treat.

  Work Experince
</h2>
<p class = "IT-past">
In 2019, I was given the oppotunity to work for a week in a company that creates
AI bots to automate work for others. It gave me he oppotunity to work in the IT
career and collaberate with other IT professionals.

  HSC
</h2>
<p class = "IT-past">
During 2021, I underwent the High School Certificate (HSC). This was a challanging
time as the lockdown resutled in no trial exam and no face-to-face learning for a
whole term. Another challange was how the HSC dates kept being moved, leaving students
with uncertainty on the exact date. However, I was able to complete my HSC and recive
my ATAR
