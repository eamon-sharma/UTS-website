    The overall design of my website was made to meet the UTS-Requirements that
    were detailed in the assignment section of Canvas. This included the implementation of
    a css page that is utilized by styling the HTML of the page. This included utilizing
    CSS attributes such as classes, Id's, Div's and other attributes to styleize the
    website. The use of an external CSS stylesheet was use for two main reasons. One
    being that the assignment required it, but it is also the most effective way
    of adding CSS to the webpage in an organized mannor. The CSS classes were named
    according to what the style was referecning, making the overall readability of the
    site to a developer easier. The overll website that the
    stylesheet is accessing is composed of 4 main pages (index.html, past.html,
    future.html and comments.html).

    The addition of a Naviagtion bar that was present on every page was implemented
    as a way of creating a centralized navigation system that details all pages that
    can be accessed in the website. The consistant style through the use of CSS allows
    for a unified feel to the website. The inclusion of a central element that details
    what page the user is currnetly one. This allows for the user to enjoy a simple
    naviagtion experience that is unified across the whole site. Below is an image of
    the 4 main components of a webage. The Header contains the such attributes like the
    main title of the page. Below this is the navigation section. This is the sections
    where I decided to place the Nav bar. This links all my pages togehter, as well as
    a section that details what page the user is on. The style of the Nav bar also matches
    the overall theme of the page. The Main of the website is where all the texts, images
    and lists are contained. This is where I also placed the majority of the text.</p>

    The overall aesthetics of the website was to be livley and bright. The overall
    bright colours that are found in every interactable section of the website to be
    match the background. The nav bar uses the same colour as the background image
    to create a more unified feel of the overall page. The light-grey transparent box
    that the text sits in is used as a way to contain and organize all the text on
    different pages, whilst addinf to the unified look by making the box present
    on every page nd placing the text in it. The title on every page that displays
    what page the user is on is present as an accessability issue. Although the page
    name is located in the nav bar, having a larger, more present title helps those
    who are sight-impared. The bright background image was also used as a way to help
    those who have issues reading text. The bright contrast of the background and
    the choice for the black text to allow for easier readability. The website also allows for
    users to not have to interact with a mouse, as the nav bar is "tab-able", which
    means that keyboard only inout is possible.
